                    One of, if not the biggest reason you'd want to join an entrepreneurship community is the chance to
                    learn from one another.

                    Joining a community of like-minded people means that you have an increased chance of meeting someone
                    who's willing to take you under their wing and mentor you. Having a strong mentor who's willing to
                    guide you and give you the benefit of their experience means that you can avoid making costly
                    mistakes that could potentially derail your startup and your career. In fact, it's been proven that
                    having a strong mentor can be the key difference between a failed and a successful entrepreneur.

                    By immersing yourself in a community, you also give yourself a chance to learn from the overall
                    group, mining the wisdom of several people and helping each other out along the way. You can also
                    create a mastermind group of trusted peers who give each other the advice and feedback every
                    entrepreneur needs, especially those just starting their journeys.

                    Joining any community means that you have a chance to improve your professional and personal
                    network.

                    When you integrate into a community, you're giving yourself the opportunity to connect with
                    influencers and to raise your own profile. One of the most important things about networking is that
                    you can get your name known by people who have the power to open doors for you. And ideally, you can
                    return the favor for others.

                    Getting to know influencers who are willing to vouch for you can be all the social proof you need to
                    raise your profile as an entrepreneur. Their recommendations can give you the credibility you need
                    to solidify your own position as an influencer. Even better, having a whole group of entrepreneurs
                    willing to vouch for you significantly raises your profile to other groups, such as potential
                    investors.

                    One of the biggest threats to an entrepreneur's success is becoming isolated and losing their
                    imagination. A fast way to failure in the startup world is never learning how to evolve and adapt,
                    something that is very difficult to learn on your own. There are countless stories of people who
                    thrive early on, but isolate themselves from others and stagnate creatively as a result.

                    Communities, by their very nature, contain a diversity of opinion, ideas, and knowledge that you
                    would never encounter alone. Just being in proximity of such a whirlwind of ideas means that you're
                    constantly challenging yourself to think creatively and constantly reconsider what you know.
                    You might even encounter a solution to a problem that you would have never thought of by yourself.

                    You don't need to look any further in history than the "Vagabonds" for the perfect example of
                    amazing people inspiring each other. The group consisted of notable industrialists like Henry Ford,
                    Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone, who would often go on annual camping trips together. Everyone
                    from US presidents to leading scientists would join them on these trips.

                        Having a community to rely upon means that you're surrounded by people who know exactly what it
                        is
                        you're going through.

                        Entrepreneurship is said to be a lonely journey, and it often can be. It can feel like the
                        weight of
                        the world is on your shoulders when you have no one in your life to share your experiences with.
                        It can
                        feel isolating and, more often than not, most entrepreneurs give up because they just don't have
                        the
                        motivation to keep going.

                        Let's be honest here, startup founders are a bit of a weird bunch. It can be hard to connect
                        with
                        other people because they're unable to see the way you view the world, or comprehend why you
                        would be so
                        passionate about something that it borders on obsession.
                        What a community of like-minded people provides, more than anything else, is a support network
                        of
                        people who are going through the exact same journey as you.

                        Even if they're at different stages of the journey, they'll understand what it is you're going
                        through and be able to give you the support you need to keep going.

                        Being an entrepreneur is more than just having the business sense to get a startup up and
                        running.
                        It takes a lot of mental and emotional energy, and having someone, let alone a whole group of
                        people,
                        to talk to about your journey can be all you need to keep plowing ahead.
